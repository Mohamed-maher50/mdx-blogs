# Mastering Cloud Computing and DevOps in 2025

Cloud computing and DevOps have become essential for building modern, scalable, and resilient applications. Understanding how to leverage cloud platforms, implement infrastructure as code, automate deployments, and monitor applications is critical for developers and operations teams alike.

This guide provides practical knowledge and best practices for mastering Cloud and DevOps workflows in 2025.

## 1. Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing enables on-demand access to computing resources without managing physical hardware. The three main service models:

1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Virtual machines, storage, and networking (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine)
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Managed platforms for apps (e.g., Heroku, Azure App Service)
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Fully managed software (e.g., Google Workspace, Salesforce)

### 1.1 Popular Cloud Providers

- **AWS** – Most extensive cloud ecosystem with wide range of services
- **Microsoft Azure** – Integrated with Microsoft ecosystem, great for enterprises
- **Google Cloud** – Strong in data analytics, AI/ML, and scalable infrastructure

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IaC allows you to manage and provision cloud resources using code:

- **Terraform** – Multi-cloud IaC tool
- **AWS CloudFormation** – Native IaC for AWS
- **Pulumi** – Write infrastructure using TypeScript, Python, or Go

```hcl
# Example Terraform for AWS S3 bucket
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-app-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}
```
