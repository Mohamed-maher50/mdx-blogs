# Getting Started with React 19

React 19 is here — and it’s a big one. After several years of incremental improvements, React has introduced features that simplify state management, optimize rendering, and improve developer ergonomics.

If you’re already familiar with React 18, this guide will help you understand what’s new, what’s changed, and how to start using React 19 today.

## Why React 19 Matters

React 19 builds on the foundations laid by React 18’s concurrent rendering and Suspense architecture. The new version refines those ideas, bringing smoother rendering, better memory efficiency, and a more intuitive developer experience.

The most important updates include:

- **React Compiler** – automatically memoizes your components.
- **Actions API** – simplifies asynchronous UI flows like forms.
- **useOptimistic** – new hook for handling optimistic UI updates.
- **Improved Server Components** – now stable and easier to integrate.
- **Enhanced JSX transforms** – smaller bundles and better type safety.

## The React Compiler: Smarter, Faster Components

One of the headline features is the new **React Compiler** — a static analysis tool that automatically optimizes your components without you needing to manually wrap them in `useMemo` or `useCallback`.

### Before (React 18)

```jsx
function TodoList({ todos }) {
  const completed = useMemo(() => todos.filter((todo) => todo.done), [todos]);
  return (
    <ul>
      {completed.map((todo) => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```
